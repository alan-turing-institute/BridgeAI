# Process EoIs

## Introduction

The purpose of this work is to automate some manual data wrangling and validation steps that are often done when a new batch of EoIs are recieved. 
Another purpose is to create summary plots of current and previous EoIs, to summarise and visualise features of the companies that are submitting EoIs.

Prerequisites to run this code:

 - Install `R` and `R Studio` on your computer (to interact with `R`)
 - Have access to EoI csv files (these are the input to this code)

## :warning: Important note about personal data 

No data should be stored on this GitHub repo! Just the code to process the data. 

This is an `R notebook` file, to make it more accessible to new comers. 
 `R notebook` files can contain outputs from running the code chunks. 
 
**Clear All Outputs** before uploading a new version to GitHub to make sure only the code (not the output of the code) is displayed:
