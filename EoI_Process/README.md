# Process EoIs

The purpose of this folder is to automate some manual processes that are often done when a new batch of EoIs are recieved by The Alan Turing Institute team. 
Another purpose is to create summary plots of current and previous EoIs, to summarise and visualise features of the companies that are submitting EoIs.

Prerequisites to run this code:

 - Install `R` and `R Studio` on your computer (to interact with `R`)
 - Have access to EoI csv files (input to this code)

:warning: **Important**

No data should be stored on this GitHub repo! Just the code to process the data. 

As the code is a `R otebook` file, to make it more accessible to new comers, make sure it is saved on GitHub with *No Outputs*
