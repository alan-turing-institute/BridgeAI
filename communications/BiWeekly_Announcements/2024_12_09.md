# Biweekly sent on 09 December 2024

Dear all,  

I hope you’re doing very well. Apologies for the recent gap in updates, it’s been a busy end of the year. 

## Key updates: 
* Community Call/Check in: Friday, 13 December at 13:00 (Agenda draft here). Join us for a brief check-in where Winn Faria from IUK will invite ISAs, AAs, and alumni to join the BridgeAI Advisory Group 

* AI Insight Chats 2025: Would you like to co-design a session? If you have an AI adoption challenge that should be discussed, please send me an email and we can start organising it. We can tailor it by sector or theme specific.  
* BridgeAI Offerings: please review the updated offerings and share with your SMEs 
 
Thank you for your incredible work this year—advising companies, participating in events, AI Insight Chats, and Capsules of AI Knowledge, Expert Working Groups, Practitioners Hub, etc. Your contributions make a real impact, and the feedback we receive is outstanding. 
I’m also creating a slide deck summarizing “Yes and No’s” for navigating funding opportunities, incorporating your input from our last call. With SME case studies and testimonials, we’ll work with Innovate UK to refine funding support models.  
From next week, I’ll be in Peru with my family for the holidays. While I’ll be working part-time and across time zones, I may take longer to reply to emails. 

Wishing you a great end to the year, and looking forward to meeting some of you on Friday!
