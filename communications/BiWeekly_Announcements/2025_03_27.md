# Biweekly sent on 27 March 2025

Dear all,  

Thank you for your participation in last weekâ€™s events and calls. It was truly inspiring to see you and hear your contributions during the ISA Onboarding Workshop, AI UK, the Agri-Food Expert Call and more. We appreciate the time and effort you dedicate to these engagements. 
Iâ€™d also like to extend a special thank you to Alpay and Rachael (ISA alumni) for their help in automating the company matching process. Rachael supported us for a few months, and Alpay has been exploring how an LLM can enhance this process. Thanks to their efforts, we are improving both the speed and accuracy of SME matchesâ€”some of you may have already noticed the difference! (fingers crossed!) 

## Upcoming Updates and Events 
* Agenda for 4 April Community Call: Please review the agenda ahead of our meeting. The first 20 minutes will focus on challenges in advisory sessions, and weâ€™ll also explore whether there is a particular type of company we are impacting the most, identifying our "sweet spot," if one exists. 
* May Community Call â€“ 9 May (12:00 â€“ 13:00): Hybrid Meeting! Following your feedback, this session will be hybrid. If youâ€™re able to join us in person, weâ€™ll be meeting in the Cipher Room. Our colleague, Shakir Laher, will also present key updates on ISA/SME support.
