# Turing/BridgeAI Team members

## As a key partner in BridgeAI, The Alan Turing Institute performs three main functions:

### AI independent scientific advice
* The Turing will provide independent scientific advice to companies encountering challenges associated with AI adoption. BridgeAI participants can collaborate with SMEs to work through their key AI challenges and receive inspiration, mentoring, and bespoke advice. 
### AI upskilling
* The Turing harnesses the UK data science and AI community to accelerate the development of AI capabilities in the four target sectors through the delivery of online training tools, advice and bespoke training targeted to the needs of Bridge AI participating organisations.
* _The Turing Way_ Practitioners Hub is an extension of the Turing Way project that engages and involves industry experts, called Experts in Residence (EiRs), from partnering organisations. This initiative aims to advance their efforts in promoting best practices in data science and AI. The Practitioners Hub serves as a platform for cross-sector collaboration, knowledge exchange, and strategic partnerships, spanning various sectors and data science initiatives, including but not limited to the small and medium-sized (SMEs) enterprises in BridgeAI network.
### AI governance expertise, including on policy, regulation, and standards
* The Turing will also support UK organisations navigating the increasingly complex AI governance landscape. As part of this workstream, the Turing will deliver training opportunities and sector-specific research on some of the most pressing AI governance issues and will engage with regional AI policy stakeholders to help consolidate a nationwide community of actors invested in responsible AI governance.
