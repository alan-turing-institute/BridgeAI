# Understanding Universities and SMEs engagement - BridgeAI 
On Wednesday 4 June 2025, from 12:30 to 13:30 we run a workshop session with the ISAs to understand the type of services and engagement activities that UK Universities hold with SMEs.

## Workshop purpose:
* Map existing University & SMEs engagement models to identify collaboration opportunities and gaps
* Co-develop improved referral and advice pathways for SMEs for transitioning from our ISA 16-hour support
* Explore how BridgeAI can support universities in building regional AI communities and strengthening SME ecosystems 

### Workshop organisers:
* Dominica D'Arcangelo, Programme Manager BridgeAI
* Alexandra Araujo Alvarez: SRCM BridgeAI
  
### Who attended the session?
* Matthew Aylet: Heriot-Wat University
* Diwei Zhou: Loughborough University
* Jennifer Williams: Southampton University
* Richard Allmendinger: University of Manchester
* Ogerta Elezaj: Birmingham University
* Shakir Laher: The Alan Turing Institute
* Anastasia Shteyn: The Alan Turing Institute
* Po Yang: Sheffield University
* James Brusey: Coventry University
* Nadin Kokciyan: University of Edimburgh
* Spyros Samothrakis: University of Essex

### Worshop structure
To structure the session a miro board was prepared in advance with the following questions:
* Which universities do we have in the meeting?
* Which universities are well-known for interacting with SMEs and why? (This question should be modified for an iteration, first include what is your university doing and then to go other well-known cases. 
* What are the mechanisms for interacting with industry? Eg Science and engineering departments, business school, CPD?
* How do we compliment the support SMEs receive from universities? How do we differentiate  the ISA work from the support received from universities?
* Suggest other solutions ISAs could provide to engage more with SMEs
* Group discussion

### Key take-away from the session:
* Universities offer a lot of activities to engage with SMEs from placements, to Innovation Hubs, and KTPs. Universities may prioritise working with bigger companies but depending on the topic they organise hubs for everyone
* Engaging with BridgeAI sectors is hard and unusual, which is a great pro for a programme like BridgeAI to exist - becoming sector agnostic could benefit sectors that are already good players in AI like Fintechs 
* ISA provide an excellent entry point for SMEs. Their free / unbiased advice is key for connecting SMEs to other opportunities, find other partners or to review their AI Strategy
* ISA offer accept and work with SMEs that would potentially not get the interest from some universities. 

### Follow-on actions
* Organise a new session inviting TUN partners - [SMEs & Universities Session, part 2](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/BridgeAI/issues/19)
* Adapt the material and organise better the questions for the new audience
