## 👋 Icebreaker 
Name / Organisation and location you are joining from / What is the AI initiative that has had the most impact in any business that you have advised or in your life? 
* AAA, The Alan Turing, London / ChatGPT has changed my life  
* RS / The Alan Turing Institute / for companies - LLMs seem to have some of the most common impact / In research – radiology 
* SS / The Alan Turning Institue/ University of Essex / Automate news processing for a finance business, completely changing their production processes. Business created a data science team around it.  
* AS / The Alan Turing Institute / I think a lot about the potential of AI breakthroughs for sustainability and managing climate change. 
* MS / The Alan Turing Institute / At the moment I am thinking and learning a lot about EU AI Act and UK’s pro-innovation approach to inform where in our workflow we change/update 
* DD / The ISA programme at the Turing!  It is so exciting to hear about the day-to-day interactions and impact with so many companies.   
* PY – University of Sheffield/ It is exciting to meet and engage with farmers, agronomists and SMES to understand their real needs and how to help them with AI tools.  
* KWY / University of Birmingham / Even the most basic AI tools in pharmaceutical secondary manufacture seem to be making a huge difference. 
* AC / digiLab, Exeter / open-sourced foundation models 
 
### Questions/Comments/Notes about Data Study Group  
* Presentation of organisations to a large PhD cohort of students: Dates 21 and 22 November in Leeds (PhD Connect conference) 
* Question: Can we access the slides later and/or have a link advertising this for companies? / The slides are on top of this document and we will make sure we have a link with advertising information 😊 / Perfect, thank you  
* What makes a good challenge?  
* Ask access to the Challenge description form and share it to rest of the team --> Jules 
Paper 
* Wenjia, propose companies outside the BridgeAI sectors? Yes, but connect to them quickly 
* JJ: can we advertise this as BridgeAI? ---> Talk to the BridgeAI team to review the engagement process 
*Po: support for organisations and the challenge in the agricultural sector 
*Maximum capacity of DSG for SME’s: this a pilot for BridgeAI, for the PhD conference there were 100 people spread in 8-10 people per group 
Action:  
 
### Tracker Document: 
* Review the [tracker](https://thealanturininstitute.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/ISA/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B33D20C64-51AD-4F4A-8139-AE073641D5C4%7D&file=Tracker.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&wdsle=0) together 
* Raise cases where support from other AA’s / ISA’s  required.  
* In terms of your advisory role, how would you define exemplary cases? https://www.menti.com/alw9ppp4z8ct or menti.com (5332 5622)
